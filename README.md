This package is an extension to the `pythTB` Python package for constructing maximally localized Wannier functions, using the same algorithms as the `Wannier90`. In essence, this package can be used along with any electronic structure code, as long as the Bloch eigenstates are provided as `NumPy` arrays with proper indexing. This could also be viewed as an early stage Python based `Wannier90`.
